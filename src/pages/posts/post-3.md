## My Coding Journey

As a **kid** I love video games and gadgets in general.  I was obsessed with technology. As I grow up I became curious of how games and softwares are made. I wanted to build my own but I have no clue how to as they were no internet at that time and no one to look up to. I started buying computer magazines like **Digit**, **Chip**, **Pc-World**. I took computer science for my degree and got graduated, but I felt like I didn't learn anything.

Everything was theory based and most of the teachers don't know anything about computers. The tech they used on the university was kinda outdated like Visual Basic and what not. After graduation I applied for jobs and went for several interviews.  
They started asking me about Linux systems and all the technical stuff. I thought I was ready for eveyrthing, but I don't know nothing. I feel embarrased, humiliated and useless ü•π. I went home and started to write down all the flaws and skills that I have to possess. And I started googling on how to code. That's when I met **Python üêç**
